3. ### What is GitHub?

   GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaboration on projects primarily based on Git. It offers a range of features including source code management (version control), issue tracking, pull
   requests, code review, and project management tools.

   GitHub is widely used by developers and teams for
   
   - managing and sharing code,
   - collaborating on projects, and
   - contributing to open-source software.

4. ### What is Git Cheat Sheet?

   **SETUP**

   Configuring user information used across all local repositories
   
       '''bash
   

       # set a name that is identifiable for credit when review version history
       git config --global user.name ‚Äú[firstname lastname]‚Äù
   
     
       # set an email address that will be associated with each history marker
       git config --global user.email ‚Äú[valid-email]‚Äù
   

       # set automatic command line coloring for Git for easy reviewing
       git config --global color.ui auto
   

       '''


    **INIT**

    Configuring user information, initializing and cloning repositories

       '''bash


       # initialize an existing directory as a Git repository
       git init
   

       # retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL
       git clone [url]


       '''


    **STAGE & SNAPSHOT**

   Working with snapshots and the Git staging area

       '''bash


       # show modified files in working directory, staged for your next commit
       git status
   

       # add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage)
       git add [file]
   

       # unstage a file while retaining the changes in working directory
       git reset [file]
   

       # diff of what is changed but not staged
       git diff
   

       # diff of what is staged but not yet committed
       git diff --staged
   

       # commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot
       git commit -m ‚Äú[descriptive message]‚Äù


       '''
   

    **BRANCH & MERGE**

   Isolating work in branches, changing context, and integrating changes

       '''bash


       # list your branches. a * will appear next to the currently active branch
       git branch
   

       # create a new branch at the current commit
       git branch [branch-name]
   

       # switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory
       git checkout
       

       # create a new branch from another branch
       git checkout -b [newBranchName] [exisitingBrachName]


       # merge the specified branch‚Äôs history into the current one
       git merge [branch]
   

       # show all commits in the current branch‚Äôs history
       git log


       '''


    **INSPECT & COMPARE**

   Examining logs, diffs and object information

       '''bash


       # show the commit history for the currently active branch
       git log
   

       # show the commits on branchA that are not on branchB
       git log branchB..branchA
   

       # show the commits that changed file, even across renames
       git log --follow [file]
   

       # show the diff of what is in branchA that is not in branchB
       git diff branchB...branchA
   

       # show any object in Git in human-readable format
       git show [SHA]


       '''
   

   **TRACKING PATH CHANGES**

   Versioning file removes and path changes

       '''bash


       # delete the file from project and stage the removal for commit
       git rm [file]
   

       # change an existing file path and stage the move
       git mv [existing-path] [new-path]
   

       # show all commit logs with indication of any paths that moved
       git log --stat -M
   

       '''
   

   **IGNORING PATTERNS**

   Preventing unintentional staging or commiting of files

       '''bash


       # system wide ignore pattern for all local repositories
       git config --global core.excludesfile [file]
   

       # Save a file with desired patterns as .gitignore with either direct string matches or wildcard globs.
       logs/
       *.notes
       pattern*/


       '''
   

   **SHARE & UPDATE**

   Retrieving updates from another repository and updating local repos

       '''bash


       # add a git URL as an alias
       git remote add [alias] [url]
   

       # fetch down all the branches from that Git remote
       git fetch [alias]
   

       # merge a remote branch into your current branch to bring it up to date
       git merge [alias]/[branch]
   

       # Transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch
       git push [alias] [branch]
   

       # fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch
       git pull


       '''
   

   **REWRITE HISTORY**

   Rewriting branches, updating commits and clearing history

       '''bash


       # apply any commits of current branch ahead of specified one
       git rebase [branch]
   

       # clear staging area, rewrite working tree from specified commit
       git reset --hard [commit]

     
       '''
   

   **TEMPORARY COMMITS**

   Temporarily store modified, tracked files in order to change branches

       '''bash


       # Save modified and staged changes
       git stash
   

       # list stack-order of stashed file changes
       git stash list
   
   
       # write working from top of stash stack
       git stash pop
   

       # discard the changes from top of stash stack
       git stash drop
